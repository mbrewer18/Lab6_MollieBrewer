# Password Endcoder/Decoder Tool  
Part of Lab 6 Version Control

## Description
This project features a simplified password encoder/decoder written in Python. It's designed for me to work with a fellow student to learn version control and collaboration through Git and GitHub.

## Features
Encodes an 8-digit password by shifting each digit up by 3 numbers.  
Decodes the password to its original form.

## Usage
1. Start the program. The menu will be displayed.
2. Choose an option. Follow the prompts to encode or decode a password.
3. View the result and repeat or exit.

## Collaboration
This project was developed collaboratively with Wesly Menard working on separate functions (encode and decode).  
Version control and collaboration were managed using Git and GitHub.
